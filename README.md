 4. Key Features
- Interactive Gameplay: Real-time input handling and decision-making enhance user engagement.
- Randomization: Use of the `rand()` function to ensure unpredictability in gameplay.
- User-Friendly Interface: Text-based menus and prompts guide users effectively.
- Modular Code Structure: Each game is implemented as a separate module for better organization and maintainability.

 5. Technology Stack
- Programming Language: C
- Libraries Used:
  - `stdio.h` and 'stdlib.h' for input/output and memory management.
  - `time.h` for random number seeding.
  - `windows.h` and `unistd.h` for console manipulation.
  - `conio.h` for real-time keyboard input.


 6. Challenges Faced
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Handling differences between Windows and Unix systems required conditional compilation and separate implementations of certain functions.
- Game Logic Development: Designing intuitive and engaging gameplay mechanics for diverse games.
- Dynamic Input Handling: Ensuring smooth input handling in text-based games.

 7. Future Enhancements
- Graphics: Adding graphical interfaces using libraries like SDL or OpenGL.
- Multiplayer Mode: Enabling local or online multiplayer gameplay.
- Game Expansion: Including more games such as Sudoku or Snake.
- Leaderboards: Implementing a scoring system with persistent leaderboards.

 8. Conclusion
The GameZone project successfully integrates multiple games into a single application, demonstrating the potential of C for developing interactive applications. The project not only serves as an entertaining platform but also highlights the programming team's creativity and technical expertise.
